# Visualization-Analysis-of-the-P2P-Data-from-Lending-Club

Hi this is Jenna. The goal of the project is to explore the characteristics of defaults in P2P lending, such as the distribution, the trend and the possible causes, so we can use the information to avoid or to mitigate the impact of defaults in the future. Specifically, I will focus on the following study questions.

First, geographically, how does the default rate differ from state to state. 
Second, how does the default rate change over time?
Third, what are the idiosyncratic factors that impact the default.
And finally, what are the macroeconomics factors that are associated with the default rate? 

PS: If you are interested, check out the presentation I made for this project.
